    <h1>Shvya – Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: [Insert Date]</p>

    <p>At Shvya, we believe in fairness, transparency, and clarity. We deploy products and services only after payment, and we provide a short usage window to ensure clients can evaluate the solution after deployment.</p>
    <p>This Refund Policy outlines how refunds and cancellations work for all Shvya products and services.</p>

    <h2>1. 7-Day Usage Period (After Deployment)</h2>
    <p>Once a payment is made, Shvya deploys the product or service to the client’s system. After deployment, the client receives a 7-day usage period to explore and evaluate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shvya CRM</li>
      <li>Shvya AI</li>
      <li>HRM + Payroll</li>
      <li>Inventory System</li>
      <li>School ERP</li>
      <li>Hospital ERP</li>
      <li>Restaurant ERP</li>
      <li>Geo-Fencing Employee System</li>
      <li>Billing System</li>
      <li>Web Development (Demo)</li>
      <li>App Development (Demo)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This usage window allows clients to understand whether the deployed solution fits their business requirements.</p>

    <h2>2. 7-Day Refund Window (Post-Deployment)</h2>
    <p>A refund can be requested only within 7 days after deployment. During this period:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A no-questions-asked refund is available</li>
      <li>A service or operational fee may be deducted, depending on the product or service</li>
      <li>Refund requests must be emailed to <strong>shvyaai@gmail.com</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the 7-day period ends, NO refunds will be issued under any circumstances. This applies even if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The system was not used</li>
      <li>The client decided not to continue</li>
      <li>The client changed their mind</li>
      <li>The business priorities changed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once the window closes, the purchase becomes fully non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>3. Non-Refundable Charges</h2>
    <p>The following are always non-refundable, even within the 7-day period:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setup & Deployment Fee (INR 5000)</li>
      <li>Custom development work</li>
      <li>Design/UI customization</li>
      <li>Integrations or APIs</li>
      <li>Add-on modules</li>
      <li>Special features or custom-coded requests</li>
      <li>Third-party services or hosting charges (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These charges cover work already performed and resources consumed during setup.</p>

    <h2>4. Technical Issues</h2>
    <p>If technical issues occur that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are caused by Shvya’s system, AND</li>
      <li>Significantly affect normal usage, AND</li>
      <li>Are confirmed by Shvya’s technical team</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shvya may issue:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A partial refund, or</li>
      <li>A full refund, depending on the severity of the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each case will be individually assessed. Issues caused by client-side devices, internet, hosting, or third-party services do not qualify.</p>

    <h2>5. Unauthorized or Fraudulent Transactions</h2>
    <p>If a payment was made without your authorization:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact <strong>shvyaai@gmail.com</strong> immediately</li>
      <li>Provide required verification details</li>
      <li>Once validated, Shvya will issue a full refund for the disputed transaction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Clients may stop using Shvya’s products or services at any time. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the 7-day post-deployment usage period ends, no refunds will be provided, regardless of whether the product was used or not.</li>
      <li>Shvya does not offer subscription plans or recurring payments.</li>
      <li>There are no partial, pro-rated, or unused-time refunds.</li>
      <li>Deployment and configuration are considered completed services, and become non-refundable after the 7-day window.</li>
      <li>Once the initial 7 days have passed, cancellation simply means the client decides to discontinue using the deployed solution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>To submit a refund request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email: <strong>shvyaai@gmail.com</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name</li>
      <li>Registered email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Product or service purchased</li>
      <li>Date of payment</li>
      <li>Transaction ID or receipt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refunds must be requested within the 7-day usage period. Requests made after this window will not be accepted.</p>

    <h2>8. Refund Processing Time</h2>
    <p>If your refund is approved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processing time: 7–10 business days</li>
      <li>Refund will be issued via the same payment method used originally</li>
      <li>Bank or payment provider timelines may vary.</li>
    </ul>
